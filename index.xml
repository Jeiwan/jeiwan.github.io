      <description>Introduction In the previous article we built a very simple data structure, which is the essence of blockchain database. And we made it possible to add blocks to it with the chain-like relation between them: each block is linked to the previous one. Alas, our blockchain implementation has one significant flaw: adding blocks to the chain is easy and cheap. One of the keystones of blockchain and Bitcoin is that adding new blocks is a hard work.</description>

      <description>Introduction Blockchain is one of the most revolutionary technologies of the 21st century, which is still maturing and which potential is not fully realized yet. In its essence, blockchain is just a distributed database of records. But what makes it unique is that it&amp;rsquo;s not a private database, but a public one, i.e. everyone who uses it has a full or partial copy of it. And a new record can be added only with a consent of other keepers of the database.</description>

      <title>TIL: Convolutional Filters Are Weights</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s common knowledge that there&amp;rsquo;re weights in a fully-connected neural network. And these weights are not constant and are adjusted by an optimization algorithm (like gradient descent). Moreover, training a neural network actually means finding proper weights.
When I started learning about convolution and convolutional networks, first thing I was introduced to is filters. Filters are said to be matrices that are applied to an image to distort it in a certain way, unveiling certain aspect of an image.</description>
