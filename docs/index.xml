Introduction Another month, another blog post! ðŸ™ˆ
So far, our UniswapV2 implementation had the most crucial part doneâ€“the pair contract. We haven&amp;rsquo;t yet implemented protocol fees (the fee Uniswap takes from each liquidity deposit) but we&amp;rsquo;ll do this a little bit later since this is not a critical part of the exchange.
Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll move forward and implement the factory contract, which serves as a registry of all deployed pair contracts.</description>

Introduction Welcome back! Today we&amp;rsquo;ll add the core functionality to our clone of Uniswap V2â€“swapping. Decentralized tokens exchanging is what Uniswap was created for, and today we&amp;rsquo;ll see how it&amp;rsquo;s done. We&amp;rsquo;re still working on the core pair contract, which means that our implementation will be very low-level and minimal. There&amp;rsquo;s no convenient interface and we won&amp;rsquo;t even have price calculation at this point!</description>

Introduction Uniswap is a decenralized exchange running on the Ethereum blockchain. It&amp;rsquo;s fully automated, not managed, and decentralized. It has come through multiple iterations of development: first version was launched in November 2018; second versionâ€“in May 2020; and final, third, version was launched in March 2021.
In my previous series on Uniswap V1, I showed how to build it from scratch and explained its core mechanics.</description>

Introduction Ethernaut is an (awesome) browser game that let&amp;rsquo;s you practice Web3 and Solidity whilte solving different tasks. The game consists of 23 levels (as of August 2021) and each level is focused on some Solidity feature or bug, smart contract design flaw, or unexpected behaviour of a contract. Your goals in each level is to hack it: to find a way of becoming a contract owner, to transfer all tokens to your own address, or abuse a feature of Solidity that wasn&amp;rsquo;t taken into consideration by a smart contract developer.</description>

Immutability gives Ethereum a big benefit: once a smart contract is deployed, there&amp;rsquo;s no way to change it. This means that smart contract logic won&amp;rsquo;t change over time and it&amp;rsquo;ll remain as reliable as it was from the beginning, e.g. you won&amp;rsquo;t suddenly see a contract doing something no one thought it could do.
However, immutability comes with drawbacks that can be significant in some cases.</description>

Introduction Here we are again building a clone of Uniswap V1! Our implementation is almost ready: we&amp;rsquo;ve implemented all core mechanics of Exchange contract, including pricing functions, swapping, LP-tokens, and fees. It looks like our clone is complete, however there&amp;rsquo;s a missing piece: Factory contract. Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll implement it and our Uniswap V1 clone will be done. However, this is not the end: in the next part we&amp;rsquo;ll be building Uniswap V2 and it&amp;rsquo;ll be not less interesting than V1!</description>

Introduction This is part two of my series on programming DeFi smart contracts. In the previous part, we learned about Uniswap and its core mechanics and started building an exchange contract. The contract can accept liquidity from users, calculate output amounts, and perform swaps.
Today, we&amp;rsquo;re going to finish Uniswap V1 implementation. While it won&amp;rsquo;t be a full copy of Uniswap V1, it&amp;rsquo;ll have all core features.</description>

      <description>Introduction I once came across a video on YouTube which was named &amp;ldquo;How I earned BNB using Flashloans to Arbitrage on Binance Smartchain BSC&amp;rdquo;. The title was quite catchy because everyone who followed the crypto field in the beginning of 2021 was aware of Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which is a clone of Ethereum, and definitely heard about multiple attacks on DeFi projects running on this blockchain.
Following the success of DeFi on Ethereum, Binance created a copy of the blockchain and, allegedly, funded multiple projects that copied most successful and advanced DeFi-projects of Ethereum.</description>

Introduction The best way to learn something is to teach others. Second best way to learn something is to do it yourself. I decided to combine the two ways and teach myself and you how to program DeFi services on Ethereum (and any other blockchains based on EVM â€“ Ethereum Virtual Machine).
Our main focus will be on how those services work, we&amp;rsquo;ll try to understand the economical mechanics that make them what they are (and they all based on economical mechanics).</description>

Introduction This blog starts a series of posts dedicated to programming of the Bitcoin network in Golang. The goal of this series is to build a tiny Bitcoin network client that&amp;rsquo;s able to:
 Connect to a Bitcoin network (whether that&amp;rsquo;s mainnet, testnet, simnet, or a local network). Introduce itself to the network (what&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;version handshake&amp;rdquo;). Get information about current blockchain state from a node in the network.</description>

      <description>Introduction As soon as the Bitcoin network started processing more-or-less significant number of transactions, it became obvious that the network is not scalable: the size of blocks is limited to 1 Mb, and since the number of transactions is growing, one day the limit will be hit and the mempool will start growing resulting in delayed transactions. This scalability issue gave birth to many Bitcoin clones, which pursued the goal of building a really scalable blockchain.</description>

 Introduction So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve build a blockchain that has all key features: anonymous, secure, and randomly generated addresses; blockchain data storage; Proof-of-Work system; reliable way to store transactions. While these features are crucial, it&amp;rsquo;s not enough. What makes these features really shine, and what make cryptocurrencies possible, is network. What&amp;rsquo;s the use of having such blockchain implementation running just on a single computer?</description>

 Introduction In the very first part of this series I said that blockchain is a distributed database. Back then, we decided to skip the &amp;ldquo;distributed&amp;rdquo; part and focus on the &amp;ldquo;database&amp;rdquo; part. So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve implemented almost all the things that make a blockchain database. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll cover some mechanisms that were skipped in the previous parts, and in the next part we&amp;rsquo;ll start working on the distributed nature of blockchain.</description>

 Introduction In the previous article, we started implementing transactions. You were also introduced to the impersonal nature of transactions: there are no user accounts, your personal data (e.g., name, passport number or SSN) is not required and not stored anywhere in Bitcoin. But there still must be something that identifies you as the owner of transaction outputs (i.e. the owner of coins locked on these outputs).</description>

 Introduction Transactions are the heart of Bitcoin and the only purpose of blockchain is to store transactions in a secure and reliable way, so no one could modify them after they are created. Today we&amp;rsquo;re starting implementing transactions. But because this is quite a big topic, I&amp;rsquo;ll split it into two parts: in this part, we&amp;rsquo;ll implement the general mechanism of transactions and in the second part we&amp;rsquo;ll work through details.</description>

 Introduction So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve built a blockchain with a proof-of-work system, which makes mining possible. Our implementation is getting closer to a fully functional blockchain, but it still lacks some important features. Today will start storing a blockchain in a database, and after that we&amp;rsquo;ll make a simple command-line interface to perform operations with the blockchain. In its essence, blockchain is a distributed database.</description>

 Introduction In the previous article we built a very simple data structure, which is the essence of blockchain database. And we made it possible to add blocks to it with the chain-like relation between them: each block is linked to the previous one. Alas, our blockchain implementation has one significant flaw: adding blocks to the chain is easy and cheap. One of the keystones of blockchain and Bitcoin is that adding new blocks is a hard work.</description>

 Introduction Blockchain is one of the most revolutionary technologies of the 21st century, which is still maturing and which potential is not fully realized yet. In its essence, blockchain is just a distributed database of records. But what makes it unique is that it&amp;rsquo;s not a private database, but a public one, i.e. everyone who uses it has a full or partial copy of it.</description>

      <title>TIL: Convolutional Filters Are Weights</title>
      <link>https://jeiwan.net/posts/til-convolution-filters-are-weights/</link>

      <guid>https://jeiwan.net/posts/til-convolution-filters-are-weights/</guid>
      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s common knowledge that there&amp;rsquo;re weights in a fully-connected neural network. And these weights are not constant and are adjusted by an optimization algorithm (like gradient descent). Moreover, training a neural network actually means finding proper weights.
When I started learning about convolution and convolutional networks, first thing I was introduced to is filters. Filters are said to be matrices that are applied to an image to distort it in a certain way, unveiling certain aspect of an image.</description>
