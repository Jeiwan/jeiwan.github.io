Introduction This is part two of my series on programming DeFi smart contracts. In the previous part, we learned about Uniswap and its core mechanics and started building an exchange contract. The contract can accept liquidity from users, calculate output amounts, and perform swaps.
Today, we&amp;rsquo;re going to finish Uniswap V1 implementation. While it won&amp;rsquo;t be a full copy of Uniswap V1, it&amp;rsquo;ll have all core features.</description>

Introduction The best way to learn something is to teach others. Second best way to learn something is to do it yourself. I decided to combine the two ways and teach myself and you how to program DeFi services on Ethereum (and any other blockchains based on EVM â€“ Ethereum Virtual Machine).
Our main focus will be on how those services work, we&amp;rsquo;ll try to understand the economical mechanics that make them what they are (and they all based on economical mechanics).</description>
