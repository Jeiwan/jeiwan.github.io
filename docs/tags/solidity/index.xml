Immutability gives Ethereum a big benefit: once a smart contract is deployed, there&amp;rsquo;s no way to change it. This means that smart contract logic won&amp;rsquo;t change over time and it&amp;rsquo;ll remain as reliable as it was from the beginning, e.g. you won&amp;rsquo;t suddenly see a contract doing something no one thought it could do.
However, immutability comes with drawbacks that can be significant in some cases.</description>
