Introduction Ethernaut is an (awesome) browser game that let&amp;rsquo;s you practice Web3 and Solidity whilte solving different tasks. The game consists of 23 levels (as of August 2021) and each level is focused on some Solidity feature or bug, smart contract design flaw, or unexpected behaviour of a contract. Your goals in each level is to hack it: to find a way of becoming a contract owner, to transfer all tokens to your own address, or abuse a feature of Solidity that wasn&amp;rsquo;t taken into consideration by a smart contract developer.</description>

Immutability gives Ethereum a big benefit: once a smart contract is deployed, there&amp;rsquo;s no way to change it. This means that smart contract logic won&amp;rsquo;t change over time and it&amp;rsquo;ll remain as reliable as it was from the beginning, e.g. you won&amp;rsquo;t suddenly see a contract doing something no one thought it could do.
However, immutability comes with drawbacks that can be significant in some cases.</description>
