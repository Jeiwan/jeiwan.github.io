Introduction Another month, another blog post! ðŸ™ˆ
So far, our UniswapV2 implementation had the most crucial part doneâ€“the pair contract. We haven&amp;rsquo;t yet implemented protocol fees (the fee Uniswap takes from each liquidity deposit) but we&amp;rsquo;ll do this a little bit later since this is not a critical part of the exchange.
Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll move forward and implement the factory contract, which serves as a registry of all deployed pair contracts.</description>

Introduction Welcome back! Today we&amp;rsquo;ll add the core functionality to our clone of Uniswap V2â€“swapping. Decentralized tokens exchanging is what Uniswap was created for, and today we&amp;rsquo;ll see how it&amp;rsquo;s done. We&amp;rsquo;re still working on the core pair contract, which means that our implementation will be very low-level and minimal. There&amp;rsquo;s no convenient interface and we won&amp;rsquo;t even have price calculation at this point!</description>

Introduction Uniswap is a decenralized exchange running on the Ethereum blockchain. It&amp;rsquo;s fully automated, not managed, and decentralized. It has come through multiple iterations of development: first version was launched in November 2018; second versionâ€“in May 2020; and final, third, version was launched in March 2021.
In my previous series on Uniswap V1, I showed how to build it from scratch and explained its core mechanics.</description>

Introduction Nowadays, the ecosystem of Ethereum is quite rich and complex. There are multitudes of DeFi applications: decentralized exchanges, staking protocols, money markets, yield farming vaults, derivatives, leverages, etc. As DeFi protocol evolve, they become more and more intertwined, allowing for new complex strategies.
In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to program a custom DeFi strategy that interacts with several DeFi platforms to produce a leveraged position that earns passive income.</description>
