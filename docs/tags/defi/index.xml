Introduction This is an analysis of an incident that happened to Iron.Finance on June 16, 2021. As a result of the incident, the price of TITAN token has collapsed to 0 and the IRON stablecoin has lost its peg to USD and hasn&amp;rsquo;t regained it yet.
There are already multple reports on the incident ( one, two, three ). While these are good attempts, they didn&amp;rsquo;t answer the only question that inerested me: what part of the design has failed?</description>
