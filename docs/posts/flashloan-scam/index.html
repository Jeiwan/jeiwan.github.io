    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I once came across a video on YouTube which was named &ldquo;How I earned BNB using Flashloans to Arbitrage on Binance Smartchain BSC&rdquo;.
The title was quite catchy because everyone who followed the crypto field in the beginning of 2021 was aware of Binance
Smart Chain (BSC), which is a clone of Ethereum, and definitely heard about multiple attacks on DeFi projects running on
this blockchain.</p>
<p>Following the success of DeFi on Ethereum, Binance created a copy of the blockchain and, allegedly, funded multiple
projects that copied most successful and advanced DeFi-projects of Ethereum.
Everything looked fine until a cascade of hacks that targeted projects on BSC in the Spring of 2021.</p>
<p>Most of the attacks used a similar scheme:</p>
<ol>
<li>A DeFi contract had a flaw in token balances calculation.</li>
<li>An attacker used a flash loan to inflate a token pool or vault.</li>
<li>The attacker then exploited the flaw by doing a big trade or token swap and tricking the contract into thinking that all balances were correct.</li>
<li>The flash loan was repaid and the attacker got away with some profit.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, for anyone who heard about those attacks it was hard to pass by (me included).</p>
<h2 id="mechanics-of-the-scam">Mechanics of the scam</h2>
<p>Author of the video shared how they managed to take a flash loan to make one arbitraging trade and earn several BNB
(1 BNB costed around $400 back then).
And, out of generosity, they shared the technique:</p>
<ol>
<li>Viewer was asked to deploy a smart contract that does all the job.</li>
<li>To cover transaction fees, viewer was asked to deposit 0.25 BNB into the contract. The contract belonged to the viewer, so everything looked safe.</li>
<li>Then, viewer needed to execute <code>flashloan</code> function of the contract.</li>
</ol>
<p>The author even uploaded the contract to <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/">Remix</a>, an Ethereum online IDE, so viewer needed
to only click a couple of buttons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hard to guess that everyone how followed the instructions lost the 0.25 BNB they deposited into the contract
and got nothing in return.
At the time of writing, more than 44 BNB (more than $17 500) were withdrawn from attacker&rsquo;s address.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-identify-the-scam">How to identify the scam</h2>
<p>First thing that stands out is the 0.25 BNB fee: this is a very high transaction fee for BSC, you&rsquo;d hardly ever submit
a transaction that costs that much.
Apparently, the attacker didn&rsquo;t want it to be too suspicious and made the amount low enough to look like a real fee
and big enough to satisfy their greed.</p>
<p>Second, never ever run a contract if you don&rsquo;t know how it works.
Here&rsquo;s the contract viewers were instructed to deploy (comments are added by its author):</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Everything looks kind of ok:</p>
<ol>
<li>Real PancakeSwap, BakerySwap, and Multiplier-Finance contracts are imported.</li>
<li>A router contract is imported (IPFS? huh?).</li>
<li>Then there&rsquo;s <code>flashloan</code> function that sends contract&rsquo;s ethers to a PancakeSwap address, borrows a flash loan from
Multiplier-Finance, makes an arbitraging swap, pays out the loan, and finally returns some profit to the contract.</li>
</ol>
<p>In fact, it does only one thing: it sends all BNB deposited into the contract, to attacker&rsquo;s address.
That IPFS import definitely looks suspicious and there&rsquo;s a reason they used IPFS there: so it&rsquo;s harder to get the Router
contract and see what it&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>The Router contract contains a lot of lines to make it noisy and hard to read but it&rsquo;s not hard to find the only
important part:</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This scam is an interesting case: most scams target non-tech savvy users of cryptocurrencies and this one
targets those who are aware of flash loan attacks and who knows how to deploy smart contracts and how to interact with them directly.
That is not a large audience but, <a href="https://bscscan.com/address/0x2593F13d5b7aC0d766E5768977ca477F9165923a#internaltx">as we can see</a>, many people have still fell
victims of the scam.</p>
