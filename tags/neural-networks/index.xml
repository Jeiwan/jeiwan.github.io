      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s common knowledge that there&amp;rsquo;re weights in a fully-connected neural network. And these weights are not constant and are adjusted by an optimization algorithm (like gradient descent). Moreover, training a neural network actually means finding proper weights.
When I started learning about convolution and convolutional networks, first thing I was introduced to is filters. Filters are said to be matrices that are applied to an image to distort it in a certain way, unveiling certain aspect of an image.</description>
