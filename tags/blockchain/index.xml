      <description>Introduction In the previous article, we started implementing transactions. You were also introduced to the impersonal nature of transactions: there are no user accounts, your personal data (e.g., name, passport number or SSN) is not required and not stored anywhere in Bitcoin. But there still must be something that identifies you as the owner of transaction outputs (i.e. the owner of coins locked on these outputs). And this is what Bitcoin addresses are needed for.</description>

      <description>Introduction Transactions are the heart of Bitcoin and the only purpose of blockchain is to store transactions in a secure and reliable way, so no one could modify them after they are created. Today we&amp;rsquo;re starting implementing transactions. But because this is quite a big topic, I&amp;rsquo;ll split it into two parts: in this part, we&amp;rsquo;ll implement the general mechanism of transactions and in the second part we&amp;rsquo;ll work through details.</description>

      <description>Introduction So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve built a blockchain with a proof-of-work system, which makes mining possible. Our implementation is getting closer to a fully functional blockchain, but it still lacks some important features. Today will start storing a blockchain in a database, and after that we&amp;rsquo;ll make a simple command-line interface to perform operations with the blockchain. In its essence, blockchain is a distributed database. We&amp;rsquo;re going to omit the &amp;ldquo;distributed&amp;rdquo; part for now and focus on the &amp;ldquo;database&amp;rdquo; part.</description>

      <description>Introduction In the previous article we built a very simple data structure, which is the essence of blockchain database. And we made it possible to add blocks to it with the chain-like relation between them: each block is linked to the previous one. Alas, our blockchain implementation has one significant flaw: adding blocks to the chain is easy and cheap. One of the keystones of blockchain and Bitcoin is that adding new blocks is a hard work.</description>

      <description>Introduction Blockchain is one of the most revolutionary technologies of the 21st century, which is still maturing and which potential is not fully realized yet. In its essence, blockchain is just a distributed database of records. But what makes it unique is that it&amp;rsquo;s not a private database, but a public one, i.e. everyone who uses it has a full or partial copy of it. And a new record can be added only with a consent of other keepers of the database.</description>
