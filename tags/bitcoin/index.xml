 DISCLAIMER. In these blog posts I describe only significant changes I made to the code since the last part. There are also insignificant refactorings and improvements I make along the way and don&amp;rsquo;t explain them here for brevity. Please, check these links to see all the changes:

Introduction This blog starts a series of posts dedicated to programming of the Bitcoin network in Golang. The goal of this series is to build a tiny Bitcoin network client that&amp;rsquo;s able to:
 Connect to a Bitcoin network (whether that&amp;rsquo;s mainnet, testnet, simnet, or a local network). Introduce itself to the network (what&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;version handshake&amp;rdquo;). Get information about current blockchain state from a node in the network.</description>

      <title>What is Lightning Network and How to Try It Today</title>

      <description>Introduction As soon as the Bitcoin network started processing more-or-less significant number of transactions, it became obvious that the network is not scalable: the size of blocks is limited to 1 Mb, and since the number of transactions is growing, one day the limit will be hit and the mempool will start growing resulting in delayed transactions. This scalability issue gave birth to many Bitcoin clones, which pursued the goal of building a really scalable blockchain.</description>

 Introduction So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve build a blockchain that has all key features: anonymous, secure, and randomly generated addresses; blockchain data storage; Proof-of-Work system; reliable way to store transactions. While these features are crucial, it&amp;rsquo;s not enough. What makes these features really shine, and what make cryptocurrencies possible, is network. What&amp;rsquo;s the use of having such blockchain implementation running just on a single computer?</description>

 Introduction In the very first part of this series I said that blockchain is a distributed database. Back then, we decided to skip the &amp;ldquo;distributed&amp;rdquo; part and focus on the &amp;ldquo;database&amp;rdquo; part. So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve implemented almost all the things that make a blockchain database. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll cover some mechanisms that were skipped in the previous parts, and in the next part we&amp;rsquo;ll start working on the distributed nature of blockchain.</description>

 Introduction In the previous article, we started implementing transactions. You were also introduced to the impersonal nature of transactions: there are no user accounts, your personal data (e.g., name, passport number or SSN) is not required and not stored anywhere in Bitcoin. But there still must be something that identifies you as the owner of transaction outputs (i.e. the owner of coins locked on these outputs).</description>

 Introduction Transactions are the heart of Bitcoin and the only purpose of blockchain is to store transactions in a secure and reliable way, so no one could modify them after they are created. Today we&amp;rsquo;re starting implementing transactions. But because this is quite a big topic, I&amp;rsquo;ll split it into two parts: in this part, we&amp;rsquo;ll implement the general mechanism of transactions and in the second part we&amp;rsquo;ll work through details.</description>

 Introduction So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve built a blockchain with a proof-of-work system, which makes mining possible. Our implementation is getting closer to a fully functional blockchain, but it still lacks some important features. Today will start storing a blockchain in a database, and after that we&amp;rsquo;ll make a simple command-line interface to perform operations with the blockchain. In its essence, blockchain is a distributed database.</description>

 Introduction In the previous article we built a very simple data structure, which is the essence of blockchain database. And we made it possible to add blocks to it with the chain-like relation between them: each block is linked to the previous one. Alas, our blockchain implementation has one significant flaw: adding blocks to the chain is easy and cheap. One of the keystones of blockchain and Bitcoin is that adding new blocks is a hard work.</description>

 Introduction Blockchain is one of the most revolutionary technologies of the 21st century, which is still maturing and which potential is not fully realized yet. In its essence, blockchain is just a distributed database of records. But what makes it unique is that it&amp;rsquo;s not a private database, but a public one, i.e. everyone who uses it has a full or partial copy of it.</description>
